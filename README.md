# Microbiome & Resistome Analysis of Rumens
Microbiome/Resistome project for a *Stats 4 Human Genetics* course.

We looked into the relationships between Antimicrobial Resistance and the Microbiome! 

The **Final Rmarkdown & pdf** are at MicAMR_Final/BhuniaElder_Final.rmd and MicAMR_Final/BhuniaElder_Final.pdf

Also included are all relevant datasets if you want to run the Rmarkdown on your own machine.

**P.S.** The figures are a little out of order (will fix soon!)
